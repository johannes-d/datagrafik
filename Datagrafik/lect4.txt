LECTURE ON P


glposition=P*V*M*vPosition

vPosition is an object
(M*vPosition)= world 

             M
          /     \
        M         M 
     /    \      /   \
   Mobj	  Mobj  Mobj Mobj

Requiers only one object in project. 
So: glpos=P*V*M*obj.
------------------------
CameraModel, be careful with the upvector,crossproduct need to be 
implemented.
(V*M*obj)=camera
in qt-> lookat function
------------------------
NDC-coordinates: convenient, origo in center,
consists of all we want to see in camera.

--> we will then end up in the viewport. So somehow we go
from "3D" to 2D.
Think about the proportions of the viewport when 
creating the P-matrix.
------------------------

Projections

classical projections: oblique, isometric, one and 
threepoint perspective.

perspective vs parallell

classes of parallell projections:
	Orthographic projections
	Axonometric projections
	Oblique projections
